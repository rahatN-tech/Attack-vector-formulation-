# Attack-vector-formulation-
Formulation of FDIA vector for cyber-physical power system such that it can bypass the conventional detectors and can create variations in system states.  This stealthy attack vector is formulated through NSGA-II optimization on platypus with contraints and bounds following system physics, which make it hard to detect. It is developed for IEEE-14 bus standard test system with the help of historical data.
